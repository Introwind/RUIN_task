# RUIN_task

In no more than a couple hours..

"The task is to produce a static (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) page of a site from a design we have provided. The aim is to produce a responsive page that looks as close to the design as possible. We have only provided a desktop view of the design so it will be up to you as to how you handle other viewport sizes. We have attached a flat image of the page and a folder of assets to this email for your use."
